6 10 11 14 15 17 24/1

#### Days using a considerable amount of OOP:
3 7 10 12 14 22(also uses polymorphism) 23 24/2

#### Days that require prior editing of the input(details are in a comment right above the declaration of the input stream):
3 6 14

#### Days that are not fully automatic:
17(will output the required path for part 2, but it must be manually compressed) 25/1

#### Days unfinished/missing:
18 20 21 22/2 25/2
